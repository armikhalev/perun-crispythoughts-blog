<p>After some attempts of using <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> I decided to learn the <a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/">Dvorak</a> keyboard layout, mainly because it better rendered an easy to remember structure in my head. I see the inherent logic in this layout, hence it is easier to learn.</p>
<p>Here are the things I deem helpful for memorizing keys on the <strong>Dvorak</strong> keyboard:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vowels are all in the home row on the left side.</li>
<li>Period and comma are comfortably at the top row above vowels, not at the bottom row which is considered to be harder to reach.</li>
<li>Letters CRL at the top right remind of an abbreviation for a Control key.</li>
<li>‘ Y ‘ is phonetically close to ‘ i ‘ as well as ‘ g ‘ to ‘ h ‘, and you can find them located above each other. Letters ‘ v ‘ and ‘ w ‘ also fall in this category with the only difference that they are placed next to each other.</li>
<li>‘ Z ‘ is in the last position as in the alphabet. Also ‘ z ‘ is under ‘ s ‘, and they are kinda similar graphically and phonetically.</li>
<li>‘ BMW ‘ doesn’t need explanation.</li>
<li>‘ X ‘ is almost in the middle as if x-ing sign where people cross the middle of the road.</li>
</ol>
<p>I started learning the <strong>Dvorak</strong> keyboard on October 3, 2016. I am writing this using it after ten days of half an hour every day practice, v e r y slowly BUT I’m <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing"> touch typing </a>. Today is October 12, 2016.</p>
