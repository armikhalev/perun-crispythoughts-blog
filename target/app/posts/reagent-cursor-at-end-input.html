<p>I have input field which has text in it on page load, for example, if I get there by url like this: <code>www.my-site/words?search=awesome</code> then I have _awesome _ in the input field. However, cursor will go to the beginning of the word, not to the end as I would prefer, because usually you delete that word to put a new word for the next search.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a> app written in <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">Clojurescript</a> I can use excellent interop with Javascript to achieve that. I found one part of the answer on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19568041/set-focus-and-cursor-to-end-of-text-input-field-string-w-jquery/19568146#19568146">StackOverflow</a>: Basically by using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/setSelectionRange">setSelectionRange()</a> method of <code>HTMLInputElement</code> we move cursor to the end of text by using length of the string as the first argument to the method.</p>
<p>Another part was to figure out how to get HTMLInputElement on page load. A <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io/">Reagent</a> component is a Clojurescript wrapper around React component, that means we can use React’s lifecycle methods. In this particular case we need <code>componentDidMount()</code> method to move cursor after <code>HTMLInputElement</code> appeared on page. Reagent has <a href="https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/doc/CreatingReagentComponents.md">three forms of components</a>, the third form has access to React’s lifecycle methods. So we have to create a Reagent class by using <code>reagent/create-class</code> where we use <code>:component-did-mount</code> key where we write the main logic of the solution. Here is the code below taken from Reagent docs but with applied solution to the input cursor problem:</p>
<pre><code class="language-clojure">
(defn search-field ;; Start input component as usual
  [placeholder
   &gt;dis-search-input-entered
   search-input] ;; These args are not relevant to the problem

  (let [] ;; Here we create Reagent class
    (reagent/create-class
     {:display-name &quot;search-field&quot; ;; Needs a display-name for debugging

      ;; NOTE: Using 3d reagent form to make cursor go to the end of the input value
      :component-did-mount
      (fn [self] 
        (let [inputLen (-&gt; self
                          reagent-dom/dom-node ;; get HTMLInputElement
                          .-value
                          count)]
          ;; setSelectionRange is js method
          (-&gt; self
              reagent-dom/dom-node ;; get HTMLInputElement

              ;; second argument can be any number higher than input length
              (.setSelectionRange inputLen (* inputLen 2))))) 

      :reagent-render
      (fn
        [placeholder
         &gt;dis-search-input-entered
         search-input]
        [:input
         {:placeholder placeholder
          :auto-focus true ;; Gets normal autofocus but puts cursor to beginning of word
          :value search-input
          :on-change #(&gt;dis-search-input-entered (-&gt; % .-target .-value))}])})))
