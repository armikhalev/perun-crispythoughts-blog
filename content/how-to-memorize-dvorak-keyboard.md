### Dvorak layout

After some attempts of using [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) I decided to learn the [Dvorak](https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/) keyboard layout, mainly because it better rendered an easy to remember structure in my head. I see the inherent logic in this layout, hence it is easier to learn.

Here are the things I deem helpful for memorizing keys on the **Dvorak** keyboard:

1. Vowels are all in the home row on the left side.
2. Period and comma are comfortably at the top row above vowels, not at the bottom row which is considered to be harder to reach.
3. Letters CRL at the top right remind of an abbreviation for a Control key.
4. ‘ Y ‘ is phonetically close to ‘ i ‘ as well as ‘ g ‘ to ‘ h ‘, and you can find them located above each other. Letters ‘ v ‘ and ‘ w ‘ also fall in this category with the only difference that they are placed next to each other.
5. ‘ Z ‘ is in the last position as in the alphabet. Also ‘ z ‘ is under ‘ s ‘, and they are kinda similar graphically and phonetically.
6. ‘ BMW ‘ doesn’t need explanation.
7. ‘ X ‘ is almost in the middle as if x-ing sign where people cross the middle of the road.

I started learning the **Dvorak** keyboard on October 3, 2016. I am writing this using it after ten days of half an hour every day practice, v e r y slowly BUT I’m [ touch typing ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing). Today is October 12, 2016.
